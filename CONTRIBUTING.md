# Contributing to Routime

> 🌐 **Other languages:** [Español](CONTRIBUTING.es.md)
>
> **Part of the [Miralante](https://apptonomia.uk) suite** —
> Routime is one of seven sibling projects (Apptonomia, Calculia,
> Memofun, Okeymoney, Routime, Sinonimia, Teclatlon) that share the
> same workflow, the same accessibility rules and the same code of
> conduct. This repo ships **Routime** itself.

Thanks for your interest in contributing. This guide covers the GitHub
workflow we follow across the suite, the project roles, and the small
set of recipes that keep every sibling consistent.

## 🔀 GitHub workflow

```text
1. 🔍 Search or create an issue (in Spanish or English)
2. 💬 Comment and agree on scope
3. 🌿 Create a branch (fork if you don't have push access)
4. ✏️  Make changes following the recipes below
5. 📤 Open a Pull Request (PR) referencing the issue
6. 👀 Wait for review (at least 1 from a maintainer)
7. ✅ Merge when approved
```

**Issue labels** (used to classify incoming work):

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `UX` | Usability or experience improvement |
| `content` | Texts, translations, accessibility copy |
| `bug` | Reproducible error in behaviour |
| `tech` | Technical implementation, refactor |
| `docs` | Documentation changes |
| `good first issue` | Suitable for a first contribution |

### Branch conventions

- `feat/<slug>` — new features
- `fix/<slug>` — bug fixes
- `docs/<slug>` — documentation-only changes
- `content/<slug>` — content-only changes (cards, activities)
- `i18n/<code>` — translation to a language (e.g. `i18n/ca`, `i18n/gl`)

### Commits

- Message in **English** (repo convention), summary in imperative.
- One thing per commit — large commits can be asked to be split.
- If you close an issue, include `Closes #123` at the end.

## 👥 Project roles

| # | Role | Reads what first |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 👤 **End user** (typical user profile) | The app — never this file. |
| 2 | 🤝 **Support** (family, therapist, caregiver, teacher) | `doc/en/roles.md` and `doc/en/quick-guide.md`. |
| 3 | 💻 **Contributor** (content or code) | This file, plus `doc/en/SPEC.md`, `doc/en/technical.md`, and `CLAUDE.md`. |

> Technical decisions live with the contributor role, **not because
> the end user is ignored, but because that is each role's domain.**
> Product, content, language and UI design decisions **are tested and
> validated with end users whenever possible**, and their feedback is
> the primary source for improvement.

## 📝 What you can contribute

- **Copy fixes** — typos, clearer wording, accessibility tweaks in
  the per-activity `strings.<locale>.js` files.
- **New activity / element** — see
  [`doc/en/creating-elements-guide.md`](doc/en/creating-elements-guide.md)
  for the full recipe (six canonical files, catalog parity, SW bump,
  didactics + easy-read rules).
- **New language** — see `doc/en/i18n.md` for the full recipe.
- **Accessibility** — contrast, focus order, focus visibility, reduced
  motion, ARIA labels, easy-read copy (UNE 153101).
- **Bug fixes** — anything that breaks in any supported browser.
- **Security headers / CSP** — tightening the policy in `_headers`.

Each of those is small enough that the recipes below should cover it
without a separate architecture review.

## 🌐 Recipes

### Copy fix

1. Edit the source-of-truth `strings.<locale>.js` (`es` by default).
2. Mirror the change in every other locale file (`en` minimum).
3. Run `node scripts/check.js` to verify key parity.
4. Open a PR with a one-line description.

### New language

See `doc/en/i18n.md` for the full step-by-step. Adding a language
requires **no changes** to the bootstrap or app code.

### Accessibility fix

Read `doc/en/SPEC.md` §3 first — non-negotiable product constraints
live there (buttons ≥ 64×64 px, WCAG AA contrast with AAA as the
design target, easy-read copy, no-pressure feedback). Anything that
breaks them will be rejected.

### Adding or tightening a security header

Headers live in `_headers`. The CSP is intentionally tight
(`script-src 'self'`, no inline scripts; JSON-LD is data and does not
require `unsafe-inline`). Tightening is welcome; loosening almost
never is — open an issue first.

## ✅ Checklist before opening a PR

- [ ] `node scripts/check.js` passes locally.
- [ ] If this PR touches a cached file, you bumped `VERSION` in
      `sw.js`.
- [ ] If you added UI strings, every supported locale is in sync.
- [ ] You tested in at least one real desktop browser (Chrome /
      Firefox / Safari) and on mobile (320/375/768 px).
- [ ] You did not add any new runtime dependency — vanilla HTML / CSS /
      JS only.
- [ ] You did not loosen the CSP in `_headers` without an issue.

- **New runtime dependencies** — vanilla HTML / CSS / JS only.
- **Analytics / telemetry / third-party calls of any kind.**
- **Personal data** of any kind.
- **A SPA, a router, or a build step.**
